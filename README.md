## About the bot

PCUBot is a bot written for the PCU Discord Server. 
The reason behind it's creation is a feature that is not present in any other bot: downgrading an user's rank every 2 warnings.
Additionally, PCUBot is capable of storing data of users that have left the server, so whenever they come back, they receive all their data back.
